  "description": "A 2D/3D math library for Haxe implemented using abstracts for maximum compatibility with existing libraries (specifically OpenFL).",
  "version": "0.6.0",
  "releasenote": "2D coordinate frames have been added. They can be concatenated, inverted, used either to transform points/vectors directly or used as a way to generate OpenFL-compatible matrices. They provide a higher (and more useful) layer of abstraction than matrices along with an intuitive 'to/from' syntax describing whether the point/vector is being transformed into the frame from the outer frame, etc. A bug in the equality operators (throwing on null) has been fixed. Documentation has been added for all public members.",
