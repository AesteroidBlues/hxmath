  "version": "0.11.0",
  "releasenote": "-Partially implemented new conventions to reduce new allocations/increase performance (issue #23): -Renamed scalarMultiply on vectors to just multiply for clarity. -Added to Vector2: normalizeTo, clamp, divide, rotate (issue #29) -Changed Frame3 to use a fully normalized quaternion inverse to avoid issues when inverting denormalized (e.g. interpolated) frames (issue #24). -In-place quaternion inverse with normalization (issue #25). -Fix for Quaternion clone doesn't clone its vector portion (issue #27). -Fast inversion for frame matrices (frameMatrixInvert) -Added Rect, the first of the geom structures.",
